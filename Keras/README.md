#Lab: Keras Traffic Sign Classification

We've prepared a Jupyter notebook that will guide you through the process of building and training a Traffic Sign Classification network with Keras.

##Setup
Clone the project from Github.

`git clone https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Keras-Lab
cd CarND-Keras-Lab`

##Instructions

1. [Download the dataset](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/November/581faac4_traffic-signs-data/traffic-signs-data.zip). This is a pickled dataset in which we've already resized the images to 32x32.
2. Set up your development environment with the [CarND Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/README.md)
2. Launch the Jupyter notebook: **jupyter notebook traffic-sign-classification-with-keras.ipynb**
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook

Since this is a self-assesd lab, you can view the solution by running the **traffic-sign-classification-with-keras-solution.ipynb** notebook. Make sure you're only running one notebook at a time.

##Help
Remember that you can get assistance from your mentor, [the forums](https://carnd-udacity.atlassian.net/wiki/questions), or the [Slack channel](https://carnd.slack.com/). You can also review the concepts from the previous lessons, or consult external documentation.
